Dear {{UserName}},

Performance Evaluation No. {{EvalID}} for {{AdvertiserName}} was only partially created as some outcomes did not achieve a sufficient number of matches back to Sky households.

The minimum threshold is 30 matches in both the test group and the control group for each outcome being measured.

Go here for more detail: {{WebsiteRootUrl}}performance-evaluations#/{{EvalID}}

You can try recreating the performance evaluation by uploading more outcomes in order to achieve a higher match rate.
